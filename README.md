```c
printf("hello world!");
```

Coders think a lot as they write code.

```java
System.out.println("hello world!");
```

How did the previous person who wrote this code think about writing this code?

How will the person after writing this code accept this code?

```python
print('hello world!')
```

Therefore the code is like a poem.


```javascript
console.log('it is only my world.')
```
